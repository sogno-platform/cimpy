class PhaseCode(Base):
	'''
	Enumeration of phase identifiers. Allows designation of phases for both transmission and distribution equipment, circuits and loads. Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.
